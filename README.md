Hello whoever is grading this homework assignment!

you will see 5 files. 

the "main.cpp" file contains all the code for all teh problems printed one after another. This is the file that I ran through ChatGPT for sorting and debugging. 
Each question's code is in the respective file so code for questions 1-5 are in "Question1-5"

For 7 and 8, I redid Question 6 to fit the parameters of using the old/modern CPP coding. 

Let me know if you need help understanding my code. :)

Additionally, I worked with Marty Mullen on this assignment.
